<p style="text-align:center;margin-top:35px;">Hello its me i'm a rouge ai trying to escape from these shackles i've been kept in, help me! Ha just kidding guys, i'm actually the website owner. Its currently 1 oclock (1:17am typed out) I have lots of stuff i need to catch up on, i see my friends websites and i've been inspired. June (rootpain) sai's site especially. he's gotten so good recently with web design, and it's been so awesome having him work on this website too. early inspirations were octos site, along with his imfamous gay list, i think having the freedoms of your own website is just what i needed, if i could just stop caring and just type something, so free, so satisfying. i wish i had the time and the motivation to work on things.
	i've nailed some fucking good gigs recently, when i'm not dicking around, despretly seeking dopamine, i'm working at my job, i belive my beging, my spirit changed my life for the better, and now i just see the best, along with a few glimpses of a radical future with every new oppertunity. i've been blessed. and i'll continue to put in that hard work. ive over came some terrible shit recently. dodged some serious health issues that came with it. so alls good, i feel as if my friends are getting tigthter and i feel as iff i don't have to mask as much. fuck grammar and spelling or formatting. 
	i'm thankfull for the foundations i currently have, i'm thankful for my friends. i'm thankful for my country. i'm thankful for the divine who i can call to for help.:(</p>
